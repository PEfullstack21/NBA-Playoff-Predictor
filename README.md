NBA Playoff Predictor with Machine Learning

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is comprised of 30 teams split between two conferences. Each team plays 82 regular season games and based on their respective win-loss record they are ranked. The top 6 teams are considered play-off teams and the last four will play against each other in play-in tournament.
