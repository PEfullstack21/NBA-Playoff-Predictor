Pumps are the lifeblood of any fluid manufacturing process. Itâ€™s a signature piece of manufacturing equipment that transports fluid from one area to another. Doing so allows for commercial production of any item to get safely and effectively to the consumer. While a pump can be viewed a simple piece of a equipment that engineers design, if there is not enough information they can become complex, hard to maintain, and cause massive amounts of manufacturing downtime. Pump manufacturers sell a pump and do not necessarily understand all the parameters in which the pump will need to work. Engineers need to consider questions such as

- What can we do to minimize downtime in the manufacturing process? 
- How do we ensure that the pump can be easily maintained? 
- How can the knowledge be easily transferred to the customers maintenance team? 

I decided to parse through all the pumps I have worked in all my project and built a machine learning system to help engineer better design pumps
