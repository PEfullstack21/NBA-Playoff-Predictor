Pumps are the lifeblood of any fluid manufacturing process. Itâ€™s a signature piece of manufacturing equipment that transports fluid from one area to another. Doing so allows for commercial production of any item to get safely and effectively to the consumer. While a pump can be viewed a simple piece of a equipment that engineers design, if there is not enough information they cancomplex, hard to maintain, and if not properly specified cause massive amounts of downtime. Beyond performing an engineering calculation, more thinking needs to be done for process designer to understand how each pump fits an application. Pump manufacturing sell a pump and do not necessarily understand all the parameters in which the pump will need to work. Engineers need to consider questions such as

- What can we do to minimize downtime in the manufacturing process? 
- How do we ensure that the pump can be easily maintained? 
- How can the knowledge be easily transferred to the customers maintenance team? 

I decided to parse through all the pumps I have worked in all my project and built a machine learning system to help engineer better specify pumps.
